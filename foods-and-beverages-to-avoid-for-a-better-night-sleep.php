                                    <p>Switching off or calling it a day after a long tiring day is a struggle for almost all of us. The variations in one’s sleeping patterns hinders the day-to-day activities leading to less productivity. Sleep can be affected due to various reasons. It may be because of work pressure, night shifts at work, or sometimes simply the erratic sleeping schedules of a person, the food we eat, the kind of beverages we consume, other mental health factors and so on.</p>
                                    <p>If you have tried every possible remedy to put yourself to sleep and if you’re still unsuccessful then it may primarily be the foods that you eat and other eating habits.</p>

<p>Before we can have a read at the foods that causes sleep disruptions, let’s take a look at the other factors for poor sleep cycle.

                                <h3>Eating late night:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Eating at odd times can slow down the metabolism rate and also take a long time to digest thereby decreasing the quality of sleep.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Portion control:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>The amount of intake also determines ones’ sleep schedule. It is always recommended to have a light dinner before hitting the sack.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Avoiding Stimulants:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>It is always recommended to avoid stimulants such as caffeine, chocolates, and other sugary foods as all these tend to keep one awake at night.</p>

                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;font-size: 23px;text-transform:uppercase;text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;">Foods that can be avoided for a healthy sleep</h3>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Chocolate:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>As much as chocolates are everyone’s favourite it certainly is not a favourite for your sleep. High sugar levels in chocolate interferes with our sleeping patterns. This has to be avoided as a late-night snacking. Chocolate consumption can cause rapid eye movements and make you feel groggy the next day.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Cheese:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Cheese when consumed in small levels is good for health. However, consuming cheese right before you go to bed can be sleep’s worst nightmares. Strong or aged cheese have high levels of amino acids, tyramine which makes us feel alert for a number of hours</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Spicy foods:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Generally, we Indians are used to having spicy foods, curries etc in our foods. These foods take time to digest and may cause stomach ulcers in most people if they have spicy foods over a long time. This will directly affect the sleeping pattern. By avoiding spicy food, we can improve our sleeping patterns to a great extent.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Ice Creams:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p><b>I scream, you scream and we all scream for ice creams.</b> Ice creams are undoubtedly everyone’s comfort food. You can have an ice cream when you’re extremely happy or when you feel low. This is also one of the main foods eaten as binge eating. This has its own disadvantage as high levels of sugar causes less hours of sleep. Sugar can keep us awake in the nights.</p>

                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Chips and other salty foods:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Chips, fries and other salty foods like salted and spiced nuts, finger foods should be avoided before going to bed as salt dehydrates the body and increases water retention and causes tiredness and fatigue.</p>
                                    
                                    <br><p>The best foods for sleep include Cherries, Raw Honey, Almonds and Bananas</p>

                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Alcohol:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Considered the arch enemy of sleep, it is advised to avoid alcohol for a healthy sleep. While we think a peg or two helps us sleep better, it only causes lack of sleep and sometimes insomnia, along with breathing problems, snoring and sleep apnea. Worst part, one may even have a hangover the next day because of alcohol consumption.</p>
                                  
                                </div>
                                
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Coffee:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>The caffeine in coffee can help one wake up in the morning. Drinking coffee before bed can have a very negative effect on sleeping patterns. It usually delays the body clock.</p>
                                  
                                </div>
                                
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Energy Drink:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>The name itself may sound misleading. Surprisingly, energy drinks have twice the amount of caffeine than a cup of coffee and leads to insomnia and sleeplessness.</p>
                                  
                                </div>
                                
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Soda:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Sodas are loaded with caffeine and sugar and we all know what will happen next!</p>
                                  
                                </div>
                                
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Water:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Surprised? You read it right. Water!.</p>
                                    <p>It is advised that one should not drink water close to the bed time. This helps prevent you waking up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. Drinking plenty of water in the day time prevents us from dehydration. So, the level of water consumed between day and night should be balanced accordingly</p>
                                  
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                <p style="margin-top: 50px;">By choosing to eat and drink right, we can sleep right in the night.</p>
