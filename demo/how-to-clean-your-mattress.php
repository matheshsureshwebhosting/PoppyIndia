                                    <p>Investing in a good mattress is important for a good sleep. For us to have a good sleep routine, we have to make sure our mattress and pillows, comforters are well taken care of. Cleaning them regularly is important as well. Mattress can attract dust mites, dead skin, and if not cleaned for a long time can even be home to bed bugs. We should clean our mattress regularly if any of our family members suffer from any allergies or if we have pets at home. Youngsters are particularly night owls who tend to snack in the dead of the night. That way, food particles get attached to one’s bed.</p>
                                    <p>Cleaning a mattress is much easier than we think. All it needs is some patience and some tips from us to help you sleep better.</p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="content-style-two" style="margin-bottom:30px;">
                                <h3>Remove all the protectors and pillow cases:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>The first step is to completely strip the bed off its protectors and pillow cases, bed spreads and comforters. These can be machine washed if it is machine friendly fabric or can be dry cleaned. Washing in hot water will help remove dust mites and other dirt.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Vacuum the mattress:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>We obviously cannot wash the mattress. Vacuuming the bed is the ideal option. This way, entire dust gets removed. Paying close attention to seams and stitches ensure any dirt/dust getting removed from the crevices.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Stain removals:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Mattresses are prone to getting stained. We may have kids at home, who eat or drink on the bed, or have babies being put on our mattresses and sometimes they may end up wetting the bed. We must be cautious while cleaning the mattress. Memory foams and mattresses shouldn’t come in contact with water as it may affect the quality of the mattress. Cleaning with a stain remover is the best. Stain removers are easily available in the markets. For more tough stains like blood, vomit, urine and other stains, enzyme removers can be used to clean it up. An alternative for enzyme remover can be dish wash soap mixed with water. Dip a cloth in the mixture and slightly rub the stained area to clean. Remember a clean mattress is the key to healthy sleep</p>

                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Using baking soda:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Almost every household will have stock of baking soda since it is an excellent cleaning agent. Sprinkle baking soda all over the mattress and leave it for several hours. Baking soda easily breaks down acids and any excess moisture or odour. The longer the baking soda sits on the mattress, the better it gets cleaned.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Use a Vacuum again:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Once the mattress has been sprinkled with baking soda and left for several hours, run the vacuum again so that any residue left from the baking soda gets cleaned</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Giving your mattress a “Sun Bath” or its share of Vitamin D:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>As much as our body needs the sun, our mattress too needs to see the light at times. It is recommended to keep the mattress out in the sun for a while at least once in six months. This will ensure that any bacteria or bugs on the mattress gets killed due to the sun’s UV rays.</p>

                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Flip the mattress:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Once, one side is cleaned well, flip the mattress and repat the vacuum process for the other side. Additionally, flipping the mattress to the other unused side is recommended every three months.</p>
                                  
                                </div>

                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>After all the cleaning is done, use a protector to cover the mattress to avoid any dirt, dust or stains. Protectors available in the market will keep the mattress from future spills and stains.</p>
