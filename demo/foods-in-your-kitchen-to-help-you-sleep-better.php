                                    <p>Sleep is an important aspect of a person’s physical and mental well-being. Although sleep is necessary, there are many people who have various sleeping disorders with insomnia being the top most condition. Sleeping well directly affects ones physical and mental health. Falling short on sleep can take a toll on the day-to-day activities, energy level and most importantly one’s emotional balance. Most of us toss and turn almost every night to go to sleep and end up being wide awake at 3 a.m. What does one do then? Quite obvious we scroll through or phone or Netflix at odd hours. As a result, the next morning we are all groggy from lack of sleep or have an irritated mood.</p>
                                    <p>Yet, there are few ways we can improve our sleep pattern.</p>
                                    <p>The first and foremost thing is to have a light dinner by 8 p.m. and hit the sack by 10.p.m latest. Also, one must ensure that they go to bed the same time more or less every night. This would ensure better emotional state of mind the next day and also you can say good bye to the blaring noise of your alarm.</p>
                                    <p>Next is to ensure that we minimise the afternoon naps. Most of us think we would just have a power nap of say 30 minutes but end up waking 3 hours later. Following this will not affect the daily sleep rhythm.</p>
                                    <p>Minimising screen time also helps.</p>
                                    <p>Apart from these there are a few super ingredients in our own kitchen that will help our sleep habits. So, let’s quickly check out those super foods.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Almonds contain high doses of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleeping and waking cycle.</p>

                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Warm milk is a common home remedy for sleeplessness. Milk contains four sleep-promoting compounds: tryptophan, calcium, vitamin D, and melatonin.</p>
