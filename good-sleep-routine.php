                                    <p>Good sleep is something that gets often neglected by us. Lack of sleep and sleep deprivation is something that causes tremendous changes to ones’ daily life routine and mental health.</p>

                                <h3>Essentials of Sleep to our health?</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Sleep strongly influences our capacity to recover both mentally and physically, allows us to store memories, influences our mood, and promotes "growing" in children. Sleep impacts every aspect of a person’s life by affecting the way he thinks, learns, behaves, feels, and interacts with others.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; text-transform:uppercase;"> The essentials of a good sleep routine?</h3>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Sleep in well-ventilated rooms and air out your home frequently:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>During respiration, we take up oxygen from the air and release carbon dioxide (CO2). Sleeping in closed, small rooms or confined spaces leads to CO2 buildup. A well-ventilated room allows a lot of oxygen supply enabling better breathing and providing quality air. Hence it is always better to open up the windows for good air circulation.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Avoid noise and loud sounds:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Noises above 50dB will shorten your total sleeping time.</p>
                                    <p>Any sound above the normal decibel level will affect the sleep quality by increasing the time it takes to fall asleep and makes one feel tired in the morning</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Turn off all sources of light:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>During the night, when the eye detects the slightest source of light (e.g., TV or electric clocks) the production of melatonin is stopped and sleep is affected. Sleeping with a night-light, staying up late in front of the TV or computer screen, and using your phone have all been shown to interfere with sleep.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Clear your mind:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>The quality of sleep is affected by ones’ mental health too. As difficult as it might be, it is best to not bring work life, worries, or the memory of negative events with you to bed</p>
                                    <p>Before going to bed, try meditation or mindfulness exercises. Pleasant or soothing music will also help.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Set up a healthy bedtime routine:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>A person needs a minimum of six hours’ undisturbed sleep. Hence it is said that a light dinner followed by an undisturbed six hours sleep is a healthy bed time routine. There is an old proverb by Benjamin Franklin which every one should follow: “Early to bed, early to rise make a man healthy wealthy and wise”.</p>
                                    <p>Sleep is the time when healing, growth and detoxification happens inside our body.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Pay attention to other factors as well:</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Sleep is also governed by various other factors like the bed we sleep in, the pillows, memory foams we use all play an important part in sleep. Getting a good night’s sleep isn’t as easy as it sounds. If you struggle to sleep begin creating a sleep routine.</p>
                                    <p>Include things that you find relaxing like</p>
                                    <ul>
